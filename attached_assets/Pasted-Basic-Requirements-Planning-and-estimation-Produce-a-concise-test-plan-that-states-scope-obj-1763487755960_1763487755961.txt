Basic Requirements: 
Planning and estimation 
• Produce a concise test plan that states scope, objectives, approach by testing 
quadrant, environments, data needs, estimation of effort, and a high-level 
schedule.  
Test design and execution 
• Design and execute functional/acceptance tests for the key flows (search → view 
event → book → cancel) and for Staff role event management. 
• Implement unit and component tests for critical logic (e.g. capacity checks, 
waitlist promotion, input validation).

CPS6002 Software Testing and Quality Assurance – Assessment Brief 
• Exercise key API endpoints with appropriate requests/responses and error 
handling. 
• Record outcomes and evidence according to test execution and reporting 
guidance.  
Defect tracking 
• Maintain a defect log with clear descriptions, steps to reproduce, and relevant 
artefacts (e.g. screens, logs), reflecting effective defect tracking and 
management. 
Artefact Deliverables 
• Test plan document (PDF). 
• Test cases and execution evidence (screenshots/logs). 
• Defect log (Excel, CSV, or integrated tool output). 
Intermediate Requirements: 
Test automation and tools 
• Introduce test automation for suitable parts of SMUCampusHub (e.g. 
repeatable functional flows and/or API checks) using popular automation 
tools referenced in the module. Generate readable reports from automated 
runs.  
Usability and exploratory testing 
• Conduct usability testing of key screens using appropriate evaluation 
methods. Document findings and improvements. 
• Run exploratory testing sessions (with clear goals) to uncover issues beyond 
scripted cases. Report notable observations and follow-ups.  
Metrics, communication and ethics 
• Present key test metrics (e.g. test coverage at the level you can justify, 
pass/fail counts, defect trends) and interpret them for key stakeholders. 
• Briefly reflect on ethics and professional practice in your approach (e.g. 
impartiality, data handling, and the implications of automation). 
Artefact Deliverables 
• Updated test plan showing automation strategy. 
• Automated test scripts and reports.

CPS6002 Software Testing and Quality Assurance – Assessment Brief 
• Usability/accessibility evaluation summary. 
• Updated defect log including exploratory testing findings. 
Advanced Requirements: 
Performance testing 
• Apply performance testing fundamentals to representative SMUCampusHub 
scenarios (e.g. searching events, confirming a booking, CSV export). Report 
response characteristics and observations about system behaviour under load 
and suggest improvements.  
Security testing 
• Perform security testing activities aligned to the module (e.g. 
authentication/authorisation checks, input handling, session management). 
Identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide evidence and 
actionable recommendations.  
Compatibility testing 
• Execute a compatibility testing plan covering common browsers/viewports 
and relevant platforms. Summarise cross-browser/platform issues and 
proposed fixes.  
Integrated Quality narrative 
• Integrate results across quadrants into a succinct test report that explains 
risks, priorities, and next steps, using module-aligned test metrics and 
performance tracking to support your conclusions. 
Artefact Deliverables 
• Final, integrated test report (PDF) including test plan, executed cases, metrics, 
defects, 
exploratory/usability 
findings, 
reports, 
performance/security/compatibility results, and risk-based recommendations. 
automation 
• Fully documented software artefact (ZIP) source code, test scripts, datasets, git 
logs, and instructions for running the solution and reproducing tests.
