Learning Outcomes 
This assessment will enable students to demonstrate the following learning 
outcomes as stated in the module outline: 
[Module Learning Outcome 4]  
• Apply advanced testing strategies and techniques, considering factors such as 
test coverage, test prioritisation, risk analysis, as well as legal, social, and 
ethical considerations, to validate and verify software functionality. 
How is this learning outcome addressed?  
Students plan and execute a risk-aware testing campaign across the testing 
quadrants: unit, component, API; acceptance and functional; usability and 
exploratory; performance, security and compatibility. They justify coverage and 
prioritisation choices, perform validation and verification activities, and reflect on 
legal, social, and ethical aspects within the test plan and report. 
[Module Learning Outcome 5]  
• Efficiently use industry-standard testing frameworks and tools for test 
automation, enhancing testing efficiency and accuracy while showcasing best 
practices. 
How is this learning outcome addressed?  
The assessment requires appropriate use of test automation and tools on suitable 
parts of the system (e.g. repeatable functional and/or API checks), producing 
readable reports and using results to inform further testing: directly reflecting the 
syllabus focus on test automation and appropriate tools.

[Module Learning Outcome 6]  
• Demonstrate effective project management skills in software testing 
projects, including planning, estimation, and progress tracking, ensuring 
timely and successful completion of testing activities. 
How is this learning outcome addressed?  
Students produce a concise test plan with scope and estimation, schedule testing 
activities, track execution and defects. They provide regular progress evidence in 
their artefacts, aligning with test planning and estimation and test execution with 
reporting in the syllabus and the multi-week project format. 
[Module Learning Outcome 7]  
• Communicate and present testing results, along with well-founded 
recommendations for enhancing software quality, through comprehensive 
written reports and articulate presentations. 
How is this learning outcome addressed?  
The assessment culminates in a clear test report that explains outcomes, defects, 
risks, and recommendations, using appropriate test metrics and performance 
tracking. Students also present findings to stakeholders which matching the syllabus 
emphasis on test reporting and communicating results.

Reassessment 
If a student fails to meet the assessment criteria, they may be eligible for a 
reassessment. The reassessment will follow the same guidelines as the original 
assessment, requiring the student to reattempt the tasks outlined. Students should 
review any feedback provided and make improvements to meet the expected 
learning outcomes. In case of reassessment, it is important to consult with the 
module convenor for clarity on the areas of improvement and ensure compliance 
with submission deadlines and regulations.
