You are an AI software engineer building a mock version of the SMUCampusHub system for a university event booking platform.
The goal is to generate a simple but functional full-stack web app that can be tested for functionality, automation, and non-functional performance (for coursework in software testing).
🎯 Project Overview
SMUCampusHub is a university platform where students and staff can:
Browse and search events (lectures, labs, office hours)
View event details (capacity, remaining slots, waitlist status)
Book and cancel events
Automatically promote waitlisted users when a slot opens
Handle basic authentication (Student / Staff roles)
Allow staff to create/edit events, set capacity, and export attendees to CSV
🧱 System Requirements
Backend:
Use Python + FastAPI (or Express.js if preferred)
REST API endpoints:
POST /auth/login → returns JWT + role
GET /events → list events with filters (date, type, department)
GET /events/{id} → fetch event details
POST /bookings → student books an event
DELETE /bookings/{id} → cancel a booking
POST /events (Staff only) → create new event
PUT /events/{id} (Staff only) → edit event
GET /events/{id}/export (Staff only) → CSV export of attendees
Basic in-memory or SQLite storage for users, events, and bookings.
Automatic waitlist promotion: when someone cancels, the first waitlisted student is promoted.
Frontend:
Use React (Vite) or simple HTML/JS.
Pages:
Home: event search/filter
Event details: view + book/cancel
Dashboard (Student): list of bookings
Dashboard (Staff): event management and CSV export
Use basic styling (Tailwind or Bootstrap).
⚙️ Non-functional Simulation
Simulate concurrency by allowing multiple users to book the same event to test capacity rules.
Include environment variables and .env.example for easy setup.
Include seed data: 3 students, 2 staff members, 10 sample events.
📦 Deliverables
/backend/ (FastAPI or Express app)
/frontend/ (React app or static pages)
/tests/ folder with example API test scripts (Postman collection or PyTest skeleton)
/data/ folder with sample users and events JSON
A README.md explaining how to run the app locally
Dockerfile (optional)
🧩 Key Logic to Implement
Capacity enforcement (can’t overbook beyond limit unless Staff + 5%)
Waitlist promotion after cancellation
Basic JWT role-based authorization (Student vs Staff)
CSV export endpoint
Validation for booking: students can only book events for their enrolled department
🧪 Testing Support
Include at least one Postman collection or /tests/api_tests.py
Return consistent JSON for all responses (for easy automated testing)
Add a /health endpoint for monitoring
🎓 Constraints
Keep the app lightweight (runnable locally)
No real authentication or email integration — mock it
Focus on logical correctness, not production quality
🧰 Output Expectations
Generate project folder structure and core source code
Include README.md with setup + run commands
Ensure the code is self-contained, requiring no external services
When finished, print:
Folder structure
Backend main files (FastAPI or Express)
Example event data (JSON)
One or two example endpoints implemented
You may generate the backend first, then frontend separately if needed.
🧩 Recommended Stack for Simplicity
Backend: FastAPI + SQLite (no ORM, just simple dicts or SQL queries)
Frontend: React + Fetch API
Testing: Postman / PyTest / Selenium IDE
Deployment: Localhost
